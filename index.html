<h2 align="center">Information</h2>
<p>
SAKADAB stands for Samahan ng May Kapansanan sa Dabaw —a village for Persons<br>
with Disabilitys (PWD’s)in Davao City. It is an association or community for<br>
persons with disabilities here in Davao City together with their families. Those<br>
who are disabled and physically struggling are residing here. The community is<br>
composed of 27 hardworking and inspiring individuals. Members here may be physically<br>
hindered due to their inability to walk, but they exert their effort in their<br>
livelihoods such as their bakery.

<h2 align="center"/>History</h2>
<p> 
Some of the members of the community found shelter in the Our Lady of Victory Training Center,<br>
but the training course was to only run for a set amount of time. Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio,<br>
different corporate groups, and various volunteer groups from Davao, were able to build homes<br>
for the SAKADAB community. The building happened through the “Bayani Build” — a week-long build<br> customarily organized by Gawad Kalinga.

<h2 id="designer">About the Designer</h2>
<div class="designers">
Enrique/Enri is an <span>understanding and compassionate</span> member of Group 2A Pignatelli. He dreams of being good at archery or badminton. He takes a special interest in modifying his keyboard and using different switches. If he could eat only one food for life, it would be ramen. He loves ramen so much that he won’t have a second thought about going out of the house just to eat ramen. The quote <span>“You do not know something's value, until it gets taken away”</span> has stuck with him and continues to guide him through life.
