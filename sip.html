<h2 align="center" style="padding-top:320px">Background of the Study</h2>
<p>
Composting helps <span id="two">enrich the soil</span> and can be a way to <span id="two">put some of our food waste to good use.</span> Chemical fertilizers—which have effects such as serious soil degradation, nitrogen leaching, soil compaction, reduction in soil organic matter, and loss of soil carbon. If we promote the idea of composting, we wouldn’t need chemical fertilizers which could pollute the soil or throw out most of our food to rot in the trash. Furthermore, composting soil is affordable to utilize in order to rehabilitate soils damaged by hazardous waste. Adding mature compost to hazardous soil speeds up the rate at which plants and microbes <span id="two">break down organic pollutants and enhance plant growth and establishment.</span> This gives us healthier soils that yield healthier plants and a cleaner environment. Plants can also contain an organism that is responsible for diseases called pathogens. Compost can work to kill both types of pathogens before either plants or people start feeling ill because of its <span id="two">disease-suppressive properties</span> for plant pathogens. It also gives us a better chance of reforestation and restoring wetlands by being able to use compost to help grow many and more healthy plants. This leads not only to a <span id="two">greener, safer, and cleaner environment</span> for the community but for the country or possibly the whole world. 
</p>

<h2 align="center">Significance of the Study</h2>
<p>
Composting is a way for SAKADAB to <span id="two">use their used eggshells and provide additional nutrients to their plants.</span> Our project investigates the effects of eggshell compost on a plant, we are utilizing a raw material available within our households to possibly help our plant grow better. Our project on the effects of eggshells to plant can be used by SAKADAB as they own a bakery that utilizes dozens of eggs to make their baked goods. Instead of simply throwing out their eggshells after using the egg, they can <span id="two">make use of this raw material</span> by crushing the eggshells and adding them to the soil in order to start off the compost. Later on, they can add this compost to the plants they have in the community and the plants can receive the calcium in the eggshells that can <span id="two">help plants build cell walls.</span> Overall, composting eggshells will reduce their food waste (eggshells) and can also provide additional nutrients to their plants that enable them to grow better/healthier.

<b style="color:#88A9C3">Problem Statement</b>
<br>               
- Will adding eggshell compost affect the length of snake plant’s (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain) leaves?
<br>
- Will adding eggshell compost affect the width of snake plant’s (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain) leaves?
<br>
- Will adding eggshell compost affect the number of snake plant’s (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain) leaves?
<br>
<br>
<b style="color:#88A9C3">Hypothesis</b>
<br>
- If eggshell compost is added to the snake plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain), then the snake plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain) will grow longer leaves.
<br>
- If eggshell compost is added to the snake plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain), then the snake plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain) will grow wider leaves.
<br>
- If eggshell compost is added to the snake plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain), then the snake plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata Prain) will grow more leaves.
